## Description for each folder

* FoV analysis: Outline code to handle a single FoV processing.
* Non-spatial analysis: Code to handle pixel based analysis of images.
* Predictions using NN SDM: Refer to an implementation of the NN SDMs [here](https://github.com/MathOnco/onubogu_spatial_analysis_of_recurrent_glioblastoma/tree/main/reflectance_sdm).
